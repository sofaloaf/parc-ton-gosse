## Different Ways Services Might Be Displayed

### Option 1: Services Are Cards/Tiles

**On the project page, services might be displayed as:**
- Cards or tiles
- Boxes with service names
- Not a traditional "list"

**Look for:**
- A box/card that says something like "parc-ton-gosse" or "backend"
- Or just shows the service name
- Click on it!

---

### Option 2: Services Are in a Different View

**Try clicking on different tabs/views:**

1. **Look for tabs at the top:**
   - "Services"
   - "Overview"
   - "Deployments"
   - "Settings"

2. **Click on "Services" tab** (if you see it)

### Option 3: Check the URL

**Your backend URL is:**
```
https://parc-ton-gosse-production.up.railway.app
```

**In Railway:**
1. **Look for this URL anywhere on the page**
2. **It might be clickable**
3. **Click on it to go to the service**

### Option 4: Check Deployments

**Try this:**

1. **Look for "Deployments" tab or section**
2. **Click on it**
3. **You might see deployments listed**
4. **Click on a deployment**
5. **It might show which service it belongs to**
6. **Click on the service name**

### Option 5: Use the Search/Filter

**Look for:**
- A search box
- A filter option
- A "View All" button

**Try searching for:** "parc" or "backend"

## Alternative: Check What You See on Project Page

**On the lovely-perception project page, what DO you see?**

**Look for:**
- Any boxes/cards?
- Any tabs at the top?
- Any links or buttons?
- The backend URL anywhere?
- A "New" or "+" button?

**Describe what you see and I'll help you find the service!**

# Login
railway login

# List projects
railway list

**If you have the backend URL, try:**

1. **Go to:** `https://parc-ton-gosse-production.up.railway.app`
2. **Railway might show service info**
3. **Or check Railway dashboard for this URL**
