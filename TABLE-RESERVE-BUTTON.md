# ✅ Reserve Button Added to Table

## What Was Added

A **"Reserve" (Réserver)** button now appears next to the "View" button in the Actions column of the table.

## Table Actions Column

Each row now has **two buttons**:

### 1. View Button (Blue)
- Navigates to activity detail page
- Shows all activity information

### 2. Reserve Button (Green)
- Navigates to registration/payment page
- Shows "Book" in English
- Shows "Réserver" in French
- Same functionality as card view

## User Flow

### From Table View:
1. Click **"View"** → See full activity details
2. Click **"Reserve"** → Go directly to booking

### From Card View:
1. Click card → See full activity details
2. Click **"Réserver"** → Go to booking

Both paths lead to the same registration/payment flow!
